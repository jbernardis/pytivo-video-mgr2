PyTivo Video Manager - change log
Version 2.0c - 10/2/2011
- added logic to sort root directory - either sort physical shares and virtual shares separately or together
- fixed bug that did not allow cache to be dynamically built a second time

Version 2.0d - 10/27/2011
- added an option usefileid, default true, to turn off the file uniqueness checking which can be expensive under windows

Version 2.0e - 10/28/2011
- fixed a bug in that prevented virtual share attributes from being parsed
correctly from the vidmgr.ini file
- added the alpha virtual share type
- added the shares= option to the vidmgi.ini to limit virtual shares to a list
of pytivo shares

Version 2.0f - 11/16/2011
- changed implementation of harvesters to use subclassing
- minor changes to the subtitle when grouping is being used
- fixed bug reported by bwall23 where port number was not successfully retrieved from pytivo config file

Version 2.0g - 11/17/2011
- added __fileName and __filePath as automatic metadata items.  These are also in the default ignore list so 
they don't show up in the info view.  If you want to see them, you need to redefine metaignore (in vidmgr.ini)
to NOT include these names
- Fixed the sorting logic that caused titles like "Alien" to sort AFTER "Alien 3"
- added new vidmgr.ini option - ignorearticle - that will ignore an article (the, a, or an) at the beginning of a title.
Thus, "The Abyss" will sort with the A's instead of the T's.  The default value of this is True so this new behavior
will occur unless you change it to False.  This also affects alpha virtual shares: The Abyss will be included with the 
A's and not with the T's
