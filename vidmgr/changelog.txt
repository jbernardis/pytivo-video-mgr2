PyTivo Video Manager - change log
Version 2.0c - 10/2/2011
- added logic to sort root directory - either sort physical shares and virtual shares separately or together
- fixed bug that did not allow cache to be dynamically built a second time

Version 2.0d - 10/27/2011
- added an option usefileid, default true, to turn off the file uniqueness checking which can be expensive under windows

Version 2.0e - 10/28/2011
- fixed a bug in that prevented virtual share attributes from being parsed
correctly from the vidmgr.ini file
- added the alpha virtual share type
- added the shares= option to the vidmgi.ini to limit virtual shares to a list
of pytivo shares

Version 2.0f - 11/16/2011
- changed implementation of harvesters to use subclassing
- minor changes to the subtitle when grouping is being used
- fixed bug reported by bwall23 where port number was not successfully retrieved from pytivo config file

Version 2.0g - 11/17/2011
- added __fileName and __filePath as automatic metadata items.  These are also in the default ignore list so 
they don't show up in the info view.  If you want to see them, you need to redefine metaignore (in vidmgr.ini)
to NOT include these names
- Fixed the sorting logic that caused titles like "Alien" to sort AFTER "Alien 3"
- added new vidmgr.ini option - ignorearticle - that will ignore an article (the, a, or an) at the beginning of a title.
Thus, "The Abyss" will sort with the A's instead of the T's.  The default value of this is True so this new behavior
will occur unless you change it to False.  This also affects alpha virtual shares: The Abyss will be included with the 
A's and not with the T's 

Version 2.0h - 11/23/2011
- corrected error in object constructor routine - reported on TCF by Lrhorer

Version 2.0i - 11/29/2011
- added thumbfolderfn to ini file with a default value of 'folder.jpg' - allows you to change the name of the folder file

Version 2.1 - 2/4/2012
- fixed major bug found by cweb.  There were actually 2 bugs.
    1) The cache was being built incorrectly - references by virtual shares were not being properly accounted for.  This problem
    would actually solve itself if the cache was written to disk and then read back, but if the cache was built dynamically, 
    this "correction" did not happen.  As a result, files could be deleted even though there were multiple references, which
    brings us to the second bug:
    2) The logic to see if a file was deletable was wrong.  I was attempting to prevent deletion of a file that had multiple
    links (logical or physical) just to keep things simple for myself.  Instead I prevented deletion if there were multiple references.
    Since virtual shares create additional references to the same file, this virtually precluded deleting most files.  The logic was
    fixed to be based on whether or not there are multiple file system links.
    
Version 2.1a - 1/19/2012
- added tagorder configuration parameter to specify a separate sort order for virtual share tags as opposed to videos

Version 2.1b - 4/23/2012
- fixed a bug reported by Larrs - when selecting a tivo from a list with more that 1 page's worth, pagination was not handled correctly

6/24/2012 - without renumbering release - I added the -v option to BuildCache.py to receive additional information about the cache
build process to help debug metadata issues - as requested by lrhorer.

Version 2.1c - 8/24/2012
- added a feature that records the pushdate into the meta data and optionally writes it out to the meta file

Version 2.2 - 12/3/2012
- added the ability to have artwork/thumbnail images for virtual shares (and physical shares) and for the subtending directories

Version 2.2a - 4/10/2013
- added a new config option, sorttivosbyname.  If set to true (the default) tivos will be listed in
	alphabetical order by their name.  If false, they will be in the numeric order in which they are
	listed in the ini file
	
Version 2.2b - 4/24/2013
- added a new grouping item - alpha - to break virtual shares into folders based on the first character of their title item.  Also 
  allowed  grouping with a list that had been previously disallowed.
  
 Version 2.2c - 5/8/2013
 - fix a bug that caused a crash when pushing a video if the sortroot option is True and a virtual
 share sorts into the first position
 - added the name(s) of tivo's pushed to when adding push data to the meta file.  Changed setting savepushdate to savepushdata
 to encompass this additional functionality, but retained the name savepushdate for backward compatability.  The names are synonyms.
 
 Version 2.2d - 6/15/2013
 - fixed a bug related to the 2.2c fix when pushing a video
 
 Version 2.2e - 5/4/2014
 - fixed improper handling if integer metadata - specifically the episode number of a DVD title
 - fixed DVD Share sorting - it now properly sorts on the sort specification instead of the display spec
 - fixed improper parsing of Virtual Shares - was not recognizing 'display' settings
 
 Version 2.2f - 5/18/2013
 - added a new ini file option - metamergeparent (default false) to control whether or not to look upward in the path for parent metadata files.
